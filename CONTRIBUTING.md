# Contributing

1. Fork the repository
    * This gives you a personal copy of the project to play with and add features to.
2. Clone your fork
    * You should be cloning something that looks like [your-name]/WyvernsNest
3. Setup the project
    * See below
4. Add your feature
    * Edit code, add a .png, etc.
    * Push your changes onto your fork.
    * Please make sure your code compiles. We do not have an auto-build and test system in place yet.
5. When done, create a pull request on the main project
    * Click Pull Requests -> New Pull Request -> compare across forks
    * base fork should be ianw3214/WyvernsNest, and base should be dev
    * head fork should be [your-name]/WyvernsNest, and compare should be where you added your changes.
6. Submit your pull request
    * Keep an eye on it. Changes may be requested.
    * If changes are requested, commit and push them to your fork.
    * The pull request will automatically update.
    * A sub-team lead will accept and merge the code into the main repository.

* If you are collaborating with a friend on a feature, ask your friend to clone and push to your fork ([your-name]/WyvernsNext). You can add your friend as a collaborator to your fork in the repo settings.
* If you want to get your personal fork up to date with the main project, make a pull request on your personal branch, but this time, merge the main project into yours!
